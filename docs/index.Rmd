## About Me
I am a fourth year Statistics & Data Science major at UT Austin, minoring in Computer Science and Entrepreneurship. I was born and raised in California, so attending UT Austin was the first time I lived out of state. Previously, I interned at Salesforce and Amazon where I built classification models for internal processes, predicting market risk and identifying how client companies should be matched to sales representatives. I am passionate about the intersection of business and technology and hope to pursue a career in this domain in the future.
